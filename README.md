## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

### Useful resources

- [Jonas Scmedtmann's JavaScript course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/learn/lecture/22649007?start=15#overview) - This helped me in the DOM session. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
